Notes
-----
* The Django web server is set to ```--noreload``` by default .This means you’ll have to restart it whenever you change your code unless you change the configuration (ask us).
* If you want to keep the code that you write during the practical then you’ll need to copy your workspace onto your network drive at the end

Todo
----
* Move all data modelling to Practical 1 to work around lack of migrations in Django 1.5
* Update Django, PyDev (and Python?) versions
